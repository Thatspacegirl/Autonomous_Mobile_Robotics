## Technical Details

### Ackermann Kinematics

The bicycle model kinematics are described by:

```
ẋ = v cos(θ)
ẏ = v sin(θ)
θ̇ = (v/L) tan(δ)
```

Where:
- `(x, y)` is the vehicle position
- `θ` is the heading angle
- `v` is the velocity
- `δ` is the steering angle
- `L` is the wheelbase

### Vehicle Dynamics

The dynamic model incorporates:
- **Tire slip angles**: Front and rear axle lateral dynamics
- **Cornering stiffness**: Tire force characteristics
- **Yaw dynamics**: Moment of inertia and stability
- **Longitudinal forces**: Acceleration and braking

State space representation:
```
ẋ = f(x, u)
x = [x, y, θ, v, β, ω]ᵀ
u = [δ, a]ᵀ
```

### PID Controller

Three-term control law for trajectory tracking:
```
δ = Kₚ·eₗₐₜ + Kᵢ·∫eₗₐₜ dt + Kᵈ·ėₗₐₜ + Kₕ·eₕₑₐdᵢₙg
```

Parameters:
- `Kₚ`: Proportional gain (lateral error)
- `Kᵢ`: Integral gain (accumulated error)
- `Kᵈ`: Derivative gain (error rate)
- `Kₕ`: Heading gain (orientation error)

### LQR Controller

Optimal control minimizing the cost function:
```
J = ∫(xᵀQx + uᵀRu) dt
```

The controller computes optimal gain matrix `K` solving the Algebraic Riccati Equation (ARE):
```
AᵀP + PA - PBR⁻¹BᵀP + Q = 0
u = -Kx,  K = R⁻¹BᵀP
```

### A\* Path Planning

Search algorithm features:
- **Cost Function**: `f(n) = g(n) + h(n)`
  - `g(n)`: Cost from start to node n
  - `h(n)`: Heuristic estimate to goal
- **Heuristics**: Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance
- **Optimality**: Guaranteed with admissible heuristic
- **Post-processing**: Path smoothing and waypoint optimization
